Building the client: Make sure you have Gradle installed correctly!
1: Go into the file that you want to build and copy the path in the first folder.
2: Go into cmd(Command Prompt) and type this: cd
3: Now, put a space then paste the path then press enter.
4: Now cmd is connected to the path so now, type this: gradlew build/gradle build (doesn't matter)
5: this will run for awhile so be patient.
6: If the green text that pops up that says Build Successful, that means its finished building.
7: Now, head to the file that was built. then go to builds and the .jar should be there!
8: plop it into your mods folder, make sure you have forge 1.12.2 installed in the launcher and you should be good!
:D
